# AI-Powered Free WiFi Analytics App

This app provides WiFi usage analytics and customer segmentation for small businesses using Streamlit and AI.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

Small businesses offering free WiFi often lack insights into customer behavior and usage patterns. This project aims to help businesses make data-driven decisions by providing analytics and customer segmentation based on WiFi usage data.

## 2. Dataset Used

- **Description**: (Describe the dataset hereâ€”e.g., anonymized logs from WiFi access points including timestamps, device IDs, session durations, and usage patterns.)
- **Source**: (Mention if it's real, simulated, or from a public source.)
- **Size & Features**: (Briefly list main columns/features.)

## 3. Methodology & Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered WiFi usage logs from access points.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified user trends, peak usage times, and session distributions.
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Applied clustering algorithms (e.g., KMeans) to segment users based on their WiFi usage patterns.
5. **Visualization**: Built interactive dashboards using Streamlit for business users.
